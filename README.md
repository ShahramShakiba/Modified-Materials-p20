## Overview
Welcome to the Modified Materials Project! ðŸš€ 
  - Ever dreamt of adding dazzling animations to your 3D models without starting from scratch? This project will show you how to supercharge your materials in a fun and easy way.
  - Ready to transform your creativity into reality? Let's go! ðŸŒŸ

<br/>

## The Challenge
> #### Imagine this: <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you love the look of your MeshStandardMaterial, but you want to add a cool vertex animation. Do you have to redo everything from the ground up? That sounds exhausting! ðŸ˜±

<br/>

### The Solutions
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately, there are two ways to jazz up your material without all that hassle:
> ### 1. Three.js Hooks: <br/> 
  - These nifty hooks let you tinker with shaders and inject your own code seamlessly.
> ### 2. Recreating the Material: <br/> 
  - This involves mimicking the complex Three.js code with includes, extensions, defines, uniform merging, and more. Phew, that's a lot of work!

<br/>

### Our Approach
We're all about efficiency and fun, so we're choosing the first technique! ðŸŽ‰ <br/>

> ### Fun Twist
Picture this: &nbsp; your model's vertices twisting and turning in a delightful way, all while maintaining the default features like light, shadows, textures, normal maps, and more. <br/> By leveraging hooks, we can inject our custom code into the material before it gets compiled. ðŸŒ€âœ¨ <br/>

But wait, there's more! With this approach, you get to keep all the benefits of ` MeshStandardMaterial ` while adding your unique flair. Imagine the possibilities! ðŸŒˆ
